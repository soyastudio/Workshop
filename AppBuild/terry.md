# Elephant Toothpaste Experiment

## Purpose
- Demonstrate the chemical reaction produces a large foamy mess that looks like toothpaste squirting out of a tube.
- Learn how to plan, prepare, implement and finish a project
- Learn how to work in a team environment, and cooperate with other teammates

## Preparation
- HydrogenPeroxide 3%
- Yeast
- Water
- Dish Soap
- Bottle
- Food Colouring
- Big Plate

## Implementation
- step 1: Mix yeast and water.
- step 2: Put hydrogen peroxide in bottle.
- step 3: Squirt some dish soap in the bottle with the hydrogen peroxide.
- step 4: Mix yeast mixture with hydrogen peroxide and dish soap.
- step 5: Add food colouring.

## What happens
The mixture starts rising slowly and continuously. It grows and overflows the bottle. Then it suddenly stops completely. I touched the foam. It's completely safe to touch no gloves required. The more dish soap, hydrogen peroxide and, yeast the bigger the foam.

## Conclusion
In conclusion it was a valuble experience. It was my first experiment I did on my own. In total I had three tries.The first one failed it was a miserable blue normal liquid. I thought I put in to little hydrogen peroxide so I added alot more then my first attempt it was a little bit more foamy then my first attempt but I was still disappointed. So I checked the ingredients and the inscroctions very carefully. I tried again it failed I was getting frustrated so I tried the only thing I didn't do. Add more yeast and water and stirred it a bit and finally I did it did its foaming so I celebrated by playing with the foam.

## What I learned from the project

In the experiment I found out that more yeast is better in elephant toothpaste because what happens inside is that yeast has a enzyme called catalase. Catalase seperates hydrogen proxide into oxygen and water because oxygen is a gas it trys to escape.So the soap traps the oxygen molecles while the oxygens still trying to escape. So it creates the toothpaste like foam. Hence the name elephant toothpaste. So more yeast to seperate hydrogen peroxide means more foam to play with.
While I was setting up my experiment my dad said I was doing it wrong. He told me how to stay organized and be efficient saying one person could whip up a food dish in 10 minutes another making the same dish could take an entire afternoon because he didn't have a method meaning he didn't have a plan or the ingredients ready. Even if he knew what to do he would still go much slower.
