# Business Alignment: Delivery Goals:

    - Accelerated delivery: I finished all task on time with clear and maintainable code structure. Add comments and annotations in code. Try to use generic solutions to increase the reusability of the components. The whole development process followed the standard to reduce the risk.

    - Strive for organization wide Adoption of EDM and EDIS and provide: self-training for Kafka, Stream, Avro Data, IIB, Azure, SpringBoot...

    - Partner and recommend solutions to stake holder challenges: Schema conversion among XSD/AvroSchema/JsonSchema, Data format conversion among XML, Json, Avro. Kafka based programming

# Seek feedback from stake holders on the deliverables

    - Platform Stability, Performance and Cost Mgmt: change management for BOD, generic and common library to increase the reusablity

    - Quality (code and data) and Security (at rest and in flight): Fully annotation in coding and versioning.
    
    - Adoption of new practices and capabilities: API, ML, DataLake, IaaS, streaming, in-session interaction, metrics dashboard, cloud migration

    - Automation in processes, development and operation: workflow based development to do requirement, analysis, design, implementation, testing and deployment

    - Pro-active Support with appropriate monitoring and alert on systems we are responsible for and dependent on: support deployment and production issue fixing

# Staff: Personal growth

    - Learnings/education/online seminars: self-training for Kafka, Stream, Avro Data, IIB, Azure/Cloud, SpringBoot, Striim, Spark, Machine Learning

    - Presentations (internal + external) and Socialization: POC and Presentations for BOD common components (such as data converion, avro...)
