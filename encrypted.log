Review related error messages to determine why the administration request failed.
BIP2683E: A component was configured to use the queue manager that is specified on the integration node, but no queue manager was found for the integration node.

By default, components in IBM Integration Bus use the queue manager that is specified on the integration node to connect to WebSphere MQ. No queue manager is specified on the integration node, so the component cannot resolve the connection to a queue manager. For MQInput, MQOutput, MQReply, and MQGet nodes, it is possible to specify a queue manager on the message flow node, but for Aggregation, Collector, Sequence, and Resequence nodes, the queue manager must be specified on the integration node.

Specify a queue manager on the integration node, or use a queue manager that is specified on a MQInput, MQOutput, MQReply, or MQGet node.
BIP2871I: The request made by user 'DESKTOP-V64TGLQ\wen_q' to 'deploy' the resource 'C:/Users/wen_q/IBM/IIBT10/workspace/GeneratedBarFiles/ESED_GroceryOrder_OMS_IH_Publisherproject.generated.bar' of type 'BAR' on parent 'default' of type 'ExecutionGroup' has the status of 'FAILED'.
